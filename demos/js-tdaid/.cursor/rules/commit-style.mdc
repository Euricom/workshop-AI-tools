We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style for our commit messages. Here are some examples:
- `feat: add new user authentication module`
- `fix: resolve issue with data fetching.`
- `docs: update README with installation instructions`
- `style: format code with Prettier`
- `refactor: improve performance of data processing`
- `test: add unit tests for user service`
- `chore: update dependencies`

Rules:
- use lower case for commit messages
- keep the summery line concise
- when determining the commit prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
- the commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if changes are not self explanatory
- reference issue numbers when applicable
