# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Framework
- `vitest` is used for testing
- Tests are colocated next to the tested file
  - Example: `dir/format.ts` and `dir/format.test.ts`

## Best Practices
- Each test should be independent
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up mocks between tests
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Use `import` for test, describe, and other testing functions
- Name unit test files with the `spec` suffix
- Place test files alongside source files, not in a separate `__tests__` folder
- After creating a unit test, test them by running `npm run test:ci`
- End the end don't give a summary of changes.
