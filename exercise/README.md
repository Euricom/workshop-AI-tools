## Exercise: Building a Webshop Application or API with AI Assistance

In this exercise, you will build a webshop application using either .NET, JavaScript, or Java for the backend API, and a frontend application based on the API contract defined in the provided TypeSpec file (`main.tsp`). You'll leverage AI tools to assist in code generation, testing, and documentation.

**Option 1: API Development (.NET, JavaScript, or Java)**

1.  **Choose your preferred language:** Select either .NET (C#), JavaScript (Node.js/Express/Hono), or Java (Spring Boot) for building the backend API.
2.  **Generate API stubs from TypeSpec:** Use the TypeSpec compiler (`tsp compile`) to generate API stubs (interfaces, data models) in your chosen language.  AI tools can help translate the TypeSpec definitions into code.  For example, you could use an AI code completion tool to generate the initial controller/handler implementations based on the generated stubs.
3.  **Implement API endpoints:** Implement the API endpoints for managing users and products, as defined in the `main.tsp` file. This includes:
    *   User registration and login
    *   CRUD operations for products (create, read, update, delete)
4.  **Database integration:** Integrate your API with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite) to persist user and product data.
5.  **Documentation:** Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI. AI tools can help improve the documentation by suggesting better descriptions and examples.

**Option 2: Frontend Application**

1.  **Choose a frontend framework:** Select a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
2.  **Generate client SDK:** Generate a client SDK from the TypeSpec definition or OpenAPI specification of your API. This SDK will provide convenient methods for interacting with the API.
3.  **Implement UI components:** Implement UI components for:
    *   User registration and login
    *   Browsing products
    *   Adding products to a shopping cart
    *   Checkout process

**Leveraging AI Tools**

Throughout this exercise, explore how AI tools can assist you in:

*   **Code generation:** Use AI code completion tools to generate code snippets, function implementations, and test cases.
*   **Documentation:** Use AI tools to generate and improve API documentation.

This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to experience the benefits of using AI tools in your development workflow. Good luck!
