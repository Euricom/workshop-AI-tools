- Use `import` for test, describe, and other testing functions
- Name unit test files with the `spec` suffix
- Place test files alongside source files, not in a separate `__tests__` folder
- Use mocking and stubbing for isolating dependencies
- After creating a unit test, test them by running `npm run test:ci`
- End the end don't give a summary of changes.
