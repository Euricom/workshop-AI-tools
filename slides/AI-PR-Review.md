### Peter's Verdict

Use **GitHub Copilot PR Review** if you don't have access to **CodeRabbit**. The PR review is quit basic and doesn't provide much feedback. It is a good start, but it is not as good as **CodeRabbit**. The PR review is not as detailed and doesn't provide as many actionable suggestions. It is a good tool for quick reviews, but it is not a replacement for a human reviewer.

**CodeRabbit** is a better tool for PR reviews. It provides more detailed feedback and actionable suggestions. CodeRabbit is a better choice for teams that need comprehensive, automated reviews with actionable feedback and workflow integration. CodeRabbit is fully GDPR complient but all sub systems are in the US, whats makes it less friendly for EU customers.
